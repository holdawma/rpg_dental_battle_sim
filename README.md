# Dental Hygiene Battle Sim
A Battle sim with the theme of dental hygiene

By: Matthew Holdaway

# Game content
- The game starts by throwing the player right into the first battle with the easiest enemy. Once the player defeats the first enemy a panel with 3 items pops up and they can choose 1 item out of those 3 to enhance the stats of their character with. The game then repeats this for 3 more enemies each with different names and stats and then puts the player up against the final boss. Once the final boss is defeated the game ends.


# Operation instructions
- Run in IDLE
- Game does not change significantly with each enemy therefore no cheat codes are required to get full experience. You only need to beat the first enemy to see the "items" function.
- Most effective tactic available to beat the first enemy is to normal attack once and then use the special ability "Floss" until their health runs out.
